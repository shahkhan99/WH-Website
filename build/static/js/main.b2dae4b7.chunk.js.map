Everyone had to be laid off,\r\n                including me. I was distraught. I quit a rewarding career in M &\r\n                A to join the team only to find out that we had to pull the\r\n                plug.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                Having the entire office to myself while serving the last month,\r\n                I could only frantically think of ways to move on. It was then\r\n                that I convinced the landlord of the building to help me turn\r\n                our office into a workspace so that different businesses could\r\n                share rent while at the same time collaborate and help each\r\n                other grow.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              {!collapseID && (\r\n                <div\r\n                  className=\"btn-area\"\r\n                  onClick={this.toggleCollapse(`workhall-story-collapse`)}\r\n                >\r\n                  <a className=\"button secondary lg\">\r\n                    <div></div>Read More\r\n                  </a>\r\n                </div>\r\n              )}\r\n\r\n              <MDBCollapse\r\n                id={`workhall-story-collapse`}\r\n                isOpen={this.state.collapseID}\r\n              >\r\n                <p>\r\n                  My finance experience taught me to work on my system and run\r\n                  numbers efficiently, but my vision for Work Hall taught me to\r\n                  look at the story behind those numbers. I spent the latter\r\n                  half of 2017 researching, planning, and validating the\r\n                  business model and subsequently raised seed investment from\r\n                  seasoned investors who believed in me more than they believed\r\n                  in the idea. Work Hall was founded in April 2018.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                  I've always believed people are magic; the dream was always to\r\n                  build businesses and be around them. I wanted to build\r\n                  something that would make the whole more significant than the\r\n                  sum of its parts. As human beings, our minds are hard-wired to\r\n                  tackle problems, even those we do not have to correct tools to\r\n                  solve. I think the real problems to look for are the ones\r\n                  worth solving. And that is why I built Work Hall.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p>\r\n                  After combining all the main elements, finally, Work Hall was\r\n                  founded in

businesses helped us realize that\r\n                finding the right talent was a chronic pain because of a\r\n                skill-to-market misfit. The answer to this problem was simple -\r\n                a skill-based education system to survive the new economy.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                And so, the Work Hall Academy was born out of necessity to\r\n                democratize education and fix the broken system by empowering\r\n                creators of today with relevant and up-to-date online courses on\r\n                the most recent technologies, softwares and programs.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                We think that the future of education is digital and since the\r\n                current generation was brought up with the Internet, they are\r\n                prepared for that change. Access to our network was limited\r\n                exclusively to our members and there was no way that an outsider\r\n                without an office space could join the Work Hall movement.
